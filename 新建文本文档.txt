git status command. 

If you run this command directly after a clone:
$ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean

the command tells you which branch youâ€™re on.
This result means you have a clean working directory:no untracked files, no tracked files are modified.

 
add a.txt
$ git status
this will list all untracked files
...
 Untracked files: 
 a.txt
 ....

$ git add *
$ git commit -m "mymsg"
delete a.txt
$ git status
Changes not staged for commit:
  deleted:    a.txt
$ git checkout -- a.txt
a.txt appear again
$ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean

delete a.txt again
$ git add a.txt		 
show a waring that behavior will change in Git 2.0
this is the same as 
$ git add a.txt  --ignore-removal
$ git status will show the same as before git add, the change is not staged

$ git add --all a.txt
$ git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
 deleted:    a.txt

$ git reset HEAD *
Unstaged changes after reset:
D       a.txt
$ git status
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
        deleted:    a.txt
if not execute git reset,instead
$ git checkout -- a.txt
error: pathspec 'a.txt' did not match any file(s) known to git.
